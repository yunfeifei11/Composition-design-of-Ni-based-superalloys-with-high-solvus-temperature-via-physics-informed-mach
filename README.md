# Composition-design-of-Ni-based-superalloys-with-high-solvus-temperature-via-physics-informed-mach
A machine learning model will be used to predict the γ' solvus temperature of Ni-base superalloy, as illustrated in the schematic diagram. Data pre-processing was completed using feature engineering as a guide. The ML methods are applied to a database of superalloys in order to understand the relationship between alloy composition and γ' solvus temperature in the forward design. The input for these methods is the alloy composition, and the output is the γ' solvus temperature. In the reverse design process, we employ a genetic algorithm to solve the optimization problem. To add an additional layer of constraint, we use the Cluster Formula Constraints (CFC) approach to specify certain restrictions on alloy compositions for a particular γ' solvus temperature.
